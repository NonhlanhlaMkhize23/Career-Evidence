### Reflection
Completing the Career Development module was a powerful experience for me as an IT Communication Networks student. It gave me a clear understanding of why setting goals is so important.It’s like creating a roadmap for my career. I’ve learned that effective career counselling should help you understand yourself better, highlight your strengths, and guide your growth. This process made me realise that I’m not just working through modules to pass, but I’m building a future with real intention. The primary goal of career development isn’t just about finding a job, it’s about becoming the best version of yourself and making sure each step you take aligns with your long-term vision.

One major takeaway for me was how vital career planning and hard skills are in my field. Planning helps me stay focused, not just for the semester but for the future I want whether it’s internships, certifications, or leadership roles in networking and cybersecurity. Understanding the importance of hard skills like configuring networks or working with Linux reminded me that success in IT means being able to apply your knowledge in real situations. This module reminded me that I’m not just a student I'm a future industry leader in the making. Now, I’m moving with purpose, strategy, and confidence in what I bring to the table

  ### Reflection:
 Working through the Skills and Interests module was an important reminder of how knowing myself is key to building a successful IT career. Scoring 80% showed me I have a good foundation, but there’s still room to grow. I learned how values shape the kind of work environment and roles I’ll thrive in whether it’s teamwork, innovation, or making an impact. Understanding that skills aren’t just about what I’m good at now, but also include transferable skills I can carry into any role, helped me realise how flexible and adaptable I can be in the tech space.
 
The activity on interests really helped me reflect on what excites me beyond just academics. Knowing that interests can guide career satisfaction made me think about how I can align my passion for network cabling, cybersecurity, and cloud computing with real job roles. This module helped me connect the dots between who I am, what I love, and where I’m going. I now feel more confident making career decisions that are aligned not just with what I can do, but what truly drives me.

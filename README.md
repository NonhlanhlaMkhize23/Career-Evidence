### Reflection:
Completing the Career Development module was a powerful experience for me as an IT Communication Networks student. It gave me a clear understanding of why setting goals is so important.It’s like creating a roadmap for my career. I’ve learned that effective career counselling should help you understand yourself better, highlight your strengths, and guide your growth. This process made me realise that I’m not just working through modules to pass, but I’m building a future with real intention. The primary goal of career development isn’t just about finding a job, it’s about becoming the best version of yourself and making sure each step you take aligns with your long-term vision.

One major takeaway for me was how vital career planning and hard skills are in my field. Planning helps me stay focused, not just for the semester but for the future I want whether it’s internships, certifications, or leadership roles in networking and cybersecurity. Understanding the importance of hard skills like configuring networks or working with Linux reminded me that success in IT means being able to apply your knowledge in real situations. This module reminded me that I’m not just a student I'm a future industry leader in the making. Now, I’m moving with purpose, strategy, and confidence in what I bring to the table

  ### Reflection:
 Working through the Skills and Interests module was an important reminder of how knowing myself is key to building a successful IT career. Scoring 80% showed me I have a good foundation, but there’s still room to grow. I learned how values shape the kind of work environment and roles I’ll thrive in whether it’s teamwork, innovation, or making an impact. Understanding that skills aren’t just about what I’m good at now, but also include transferable skills I can carry into any role, helped me realise how flexible and adaptable I can be in the tech space.
 
The activity on interests really helped me reflect on what excites me beyond just academics. Knowing that interests can guide career satisfaction made me think about how I can align my passion for network cabling, cybersecurity, and cloud computing with real job roles. This module helped me connect the dots between who I am, what I love, and where I’m going. I now feel more confident making career decisions that are aligned not just with what I can do, but what truly drives me.

### Reflection: 
Finishing the Personality Assessment module with 100% gave me a real boost! It helped me understand how linking your personality with the right career path can make all the difference. I learned that personality-career matching isn’t just about finding what you can do it’s about finding what feels natural and fulfilling. For someone like me, who enjoys structured environments but also values creativity and leadership, knowing where I fit on the spectrum of personality types gives me direction when choosing roles or even specialisations in the IT world.

Learning about different personality types like Realistic, Artistic, and Conventional helped me appreciate the diversity in career choices. While some people love hands-on, practical work, others thrive in creative or organized environments. I recognised myself in some of these traits, especially the ones linked to system-based thinking and structured problem solving which fits perfectly with careers in networking and cybersecurity. This module didn’t just tell me who I am; it gave me clues on where I’d shine brightest. I'm not just building skills ,I am building a career that matches my vibe.
